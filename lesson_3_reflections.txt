When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Mostly all of the time. It's beneficial in many ways, like when you need to wwork on different computers or when you're collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we might have unpushed commits on the same branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone is a kind of copy of a repository. Fork is a kind of clone on GitHub. A branch is a list of commits.
Use a clone when you want to copy a remote repository to a local machine. Fork when you want to clone a repository from github 
to your github. Branch when you want to create a new branch of commits without changing the path that the master branch follows.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
In case you need to access it later on from a different machine, it would be already updated.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
By e-mail or someting. It would be harder to sync however I don't know how it could be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
In this way, I could request a revision by creating a pull request. With a pull request, other contributors could review my contribution
before merging with the master branch.
